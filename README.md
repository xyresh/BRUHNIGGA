# BRUHNIGGA
The Retarded cousin of BRUH, that is written in the C language


This was written using the GTK API's Available only on Linux,
i might consider doing a win32 API version of it but then the playing of the sound bit of it would
be rendered non functional so linux supremacy wil perservere!

The "AdVaNcEd" method i am using to play a sound is issuing a shell command and appending a death threat to the process it starts,
it ends in a bloodbath every time because im retarded and bad at coding.

As i have stated on the BRUH.py Project, which is superior, i do not own the Sound files.
if you own it you can bugger off i don't care.
